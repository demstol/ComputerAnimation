Emotion: Disgust

I had a dream I want to animate. 

I was in the middle of a market, in specific on the corner of the hall, everyone was gone and just a little bit of light from the outside made things barely visible. 

At the end of the hall I saw a man with a fumigation suit, he was carrrying a backpack with a hose spraying a weird substance from it, as he came closer I tried to move but I couldn't. He sprayed me with the substance and I started choking. As I was dying he took his mask off and started spraying the substance on his mouth, tasting it. I died with the image of that man creepy smiling at me.
